# IRC SERVER

## Overview
- This project is about creating our own IRC server. We used an actual IRC client to connect to our server and test it.
- IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a protocol for real-time text messaging between internet-connected computers. It is mainly used for group discussion in chat rooms called “channels” although it supports private messages between two users, data transfer, and various client-side commands.
